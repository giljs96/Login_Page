# Login Page

# About the project 

A login page, where the user enters his email and password and is directed to a page certifying his login.
If the user makes a mistake in his login or password, he is directed to a page that informs that there was an error in the login attempt.

The project was developed in PHP, HTML, CSS and the MySQL database.
The objective of this project was to apply the principles of HTTP requests, database integration, and form validation.

## Layout

The following image shows when the site is on the home page.

Here the user enters his login and password.

![login2](https://github.com/giljs96/Login_Page/blob/main/login-2.JPG)

If the user is already registered on the system, he is directed to this page, which informs the access confirmation.

![login3](https://github.com/giljs96/Login_Page/blob/main/login-3.JPG)

In the "how to run the project" section, all entries for login attempts will be available.<br>
There is no registration page, because that was not one of the objectives of this project.

![login4](https://github.com/giljs96/Login_Page/blob/main/login-4.JPG)

If there is an attempt to login with an unregistered user (as in the image above), there will be a redirection to this page (image below):

![login5](https://github.com/giljs96/Login_Page/blob/main/login-5.JPG)

In addition to the aforementioned error, this page also appears when the user makes a mistake in the password or email already registered in the database.
